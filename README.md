# My Personal Project: Book Tracker

## A book tracker for all your literary needs

This application will be used by people who enjoy reading. By tracking users' reading history, this application will be
able to recommend them other books to read depending on genre of choice and demographic.
Because I've enjoyed reading as a source of entertainment these past few years, I've often found it pretty hard to find 
books that suited my interests. Other than *Goodreads*, there are very few applications that recommend books very well.
Consequently, I've decided to create this book tracker application to fulfill all of my literary needs.

**USER STORIES:**
- As a user, I want to be able to add a book to my read list
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a book from my read list
- As a user, I want to be able to select a book in my read list and rate it on a scale of one to five stars
- As a user, I want to be able to find a book recommendation by genre
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the books on my read list
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, 
I want the option to save my book tracker list to file. 
- As a user, I want to be able to reload the state from a saved file and resume exactly where I left off at a later time
